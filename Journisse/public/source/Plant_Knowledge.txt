 Inuit name Siqpiijautit means, literally, "that which is used to remove siqpik" (discharge from the inner corner of the eye). When they are ripe the plants feel soft, and according to some elders they are intoxicants. (Ootoova et al. 2001).
It is reported that after drinking the black liquid from boiled siqpiijautit a person could not get up but just lay on the ground dizzy. In the past, before there were qallunaat (Europeans) and alcohol, people used to get drunk on this. People used to make tea from many different kinds of plants, but this was the only plant that induced drunkenness (Malaija, personal communication, to Ootoova et al. 2001).
Schofield (1989, p. 110) noted that this species [Lycopodium selago] should not be used internally. "It contains an alkaloid that can cause mouth pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Some Western Indian tribes are reported to have chewed stems for the intoxicating effects. Unconsciousness resulted from chewing as few as eight stems. Medicinal supervision is recommended for internal use" Schofield (1989, p. 110) quoted Maria Treben who warns "people who suffer from diarrhea should use the tea only with the greatest caution, as cramps in the intestines could result.".

Andre and Fehr (2000) noted that Gwich'in people know that this plant is eaten as food by geese and muskrats. The root tubercles can be eaten raw, and the leaves and stems can be steamed for nasal congestion, colds, and stomach ailments. The coarse green stems may be gathered and used to scrub pots and clean dishes.
